This is a clean-sheet design of a late-model Cessna 182T Skylane.

It incorporates numerous custom graphics on the panel and, I think, the nicest simulation
of a King KAP-140 autopilot that you'll find in any freeware plane.

Please read the LICENSE.txt file. I encourage derivative works provided that they comply
with the license, and I sincerely hope that others will fork this project, add their
own improvements, and then contact me with pull requests.
